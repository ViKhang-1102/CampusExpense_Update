## ⚠️ **Errors encountered when building the CampusExpense application**
1. **Inconsistent layout across screens** → the UI is not uniform and requires a full review of XML layouts.
2. Multilingual support not working → switching between English and Vietnamese does not function correctly, especially for currency formatting.
3. Exchange rate not updating → the conversion between USD and VND does not fetch or display real-time values.
4. Library version conflicts → dependency version mismatches cause build errors or unexpected crashes.
